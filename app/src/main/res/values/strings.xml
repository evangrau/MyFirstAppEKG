    <string name="about_me">Hey! I\'m Evan Grau. I\'m a Sophomore CS major. My favorite game quote is probably \"Making the mother of all omellettes here, Jack. Can\'t fret over every egg\" from Senator Armstrong in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance simply because of the memes. I just think it\'s funny. That whole game is just full of great memeable quotes, but that one is probably my favorite.</string>
